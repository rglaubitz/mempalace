"""Tests for ``candidate_strategy="union"`` in ``search_memories``.

The default ``"vector"`` strategy gathers candidates from the vector index
only. Docs with strong BM25 signal but vector embeddings far from the query
get skipped — terminology guides looked up by narrative-shaped queries are
the canonical case.

The ``"union"`` strategy also pulls top-K BM25-only candidates from sqlite
FTS5 and merges them into the rerank pool. Both signal sources contribute
candidates; the hybrid rerank picks the best from a richer pool.

Default behavior is unchanged ("vector") — these tests exercise opt-in
"union" mode.
